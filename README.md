# provider_immutable_state

A flutter template using [Stacked](https://pub.dev/packages/stacked) for state management and [Freezed](https://pub.dev/packages/freezed) for immutable state

## Internationalization

- Flutter localization is generated by [Flutter Intl](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=localizely.flutter-intl) package
- Just update the strings in the lib/i10n/intl\_<local-code>.arb files

## Generating files

- Run `flutter packages pub run build_runner watch --delete-conflicting-outputs`

## Generating view state files

- Run the above command and use the snippet below to generate unions with freezed
- Add this command to your user snippets in VSCode (dart.json or global)

```bash
"Generate a freezed union view state": {
    "prefix": "fViewStateUnion",
    "description": "Generate a freezed union for a views state",
    "body": [
        "import 'package:freezed_annotation/freezed_annotation.dart';",
        "",
        "part '$TM_FILENAME_BASE.freezed.dart';",
        "",
        "@freezed",
        "abstract class $1ViewState with _$$1ViewState {",
        "  const factory $1ViewState.loading() = _Loading;",
        "}"
    ],
}
```
